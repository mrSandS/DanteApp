<h1>DanteApp</h1>

<h4>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h4>

The application initially was considered to be a player for poetry (just something simple to show verses string by string, move to next and previous verse and so on) and started more like an art project. But then the concept started changing and the app getting more complicated. Now it involves more interactions between users and poets. Verses may get an emotion from a user, poets could be added to favorites, poets and verses have their rating.

Started it for getting valuable experience with new technologies like Node.js and MongoDB and getting deeper into React Native.

<h4>FOR CODE REVIEWERS</h4>

Reviewing the code please take into account that it's far from production level. Just because I don't have more or less final version of design and clear understanding of how it should look like finally as the concept is not stable now. It makes me less certain about the code structure, components functioning thus something is hardcoded or not organized in a proper way.
